### Hi there üëã

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on ...
  - Becoming more active in software development
    - Getting involved with Purdue Hackers
    - Making quick and cool projects
  - Building out my personal website
    - Thinking about adding React, making a better navbar
  - Giving blogging a go
  - Expanding my homelab

### The Lab
Currently it is comprised of:
- Optiplex 7710
- Raspberry Pi 2B+
- Acer Aspire laptop
- Lenovo SFF
- Basic Switch and router, nothing shiny or new

I'm working on containerization with Docker, and moving the Pi to be a more mobile system for hardware projects rather than sysadmin things.

Currently running a ZeroTier bridge, PiHole ad blocking, CasaOS management dashboard, a VLC camera feed (WIP), a CyberChef instance, a Tandoor recipe database, a Proxmox hypervisor with a VM or two, and on occasion a Beta 1.2_02 Minecraft server.
