### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
  - Becoming more active in software development
  - Completing the Advent of Cyber event on TryHackMe
  - Giving blogging a go
  - Expanding my homelab

### The Lab
Currently it is comprised of:
- Optiplex 7710
- Raspberry Pi 2B+
- Acer Aspire laptop
- Lenovo SFF

I'm working on containerization with Docker, and moving the Pi to be a more mobile system for hardware projects rather than sysadmin things.

Currently running a ZeroTier bridge, PiHole ad blocking, CasaOS management dashboard, a VLC camera feed (WIP), a CyberChef instance, and on occasion a Beta 1.2_02 Minecraft server.
